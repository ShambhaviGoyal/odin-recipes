# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, and the goal is to create a basic recipe website using HTML. The project is structured in several iterations, where each iteration builds upon the last, adding new features and content to the website. By the end of this project, you'll have a simple recipe website containing multiple recipe pages, with links between them and a clean, organized layout.

## Iteration Breakdown

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Created the main `index.html` file within the `odin-recipes` directory.
- Added the usual HTML boilerplate code and a `<h1>` heading with the text "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Created a new `recipes` directory within the `odin-recipes` directory.
- Inside the `recipes` directory, created an HTML file for a recipe page. The file was named after the recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`).
- Added the usual HTML boilerplate code to this new recipe page.
- Included a `<h1>` heading with the recipe name.
- Updated the `index.html` file to include a link to the new recipe page. The link text was the recipe name, and the link pointed to the new recipe file (e.g., `recipes/lasagna.html`).

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- For the recipe page, the following content was added:
  1. **An image** of the finished dish under the `<h1>` heading.
  2. **A "Description" section** under the image, with a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
  3. **An "Ingredients" section** with an unordered list of ingredients needed for the recipe.
  4. **A "Steps" section** with an ordered list of steps for making the dish.
  
### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Added two more recipe pages with the same structure as the first recipe page.
- Updated the `index.html` file to include links to the new recipes, placed within an unordered list for better organization.
